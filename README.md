# Vector-Addition-Illustrator
This Python app allows the user add 2D vectors to a plane and sum up all the vectors. This project was made as a tool for my calculus class to help display vector addition.

# Controls
Press 'c' to remove all added vectors and press '1' to sum up all vectors and display the sum.
