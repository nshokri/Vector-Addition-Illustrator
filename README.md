# Vector-Addition-Illustrator
This Python app allows the user add 2D vectors to a plane and sum up all the vectors. This project was made as a tool for my calculus class to help display vector addition.

# Requirements for functionality
If you plan to run this app, please make sure to have an updated version of Python and Pygame installed.

# Controls
Click 2 spots on the window to create 1 vector. Press 'c' to remove all added vectors and press '1' to sum up all vectors and display the sum.
